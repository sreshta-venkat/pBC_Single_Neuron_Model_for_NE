# Dual Mechanisms for Heterogenous Responses of Inspiratory Neurons to Noradrenergic Modulation


This repository contains the MATLAB codes used for simulation results reported in the paper [Dual Mechanisms for Heterogenous Responses of Inspiratory Neurons to Noradrenergic Modulation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.19416)


# File Organization

The file "pBC_ICa.m" contains the MATLAB function code describing the ionic currents and the equations for the vector field for the nondimensionalized system in Appendix B from the paper.

The file "voltage_traces.m" contains the MATLAB code to get rid of transient dynamics and plot a temporal trace of the system variables (e.g., membrane potential v).

The file "parameters.m" consists of all the constant parameter values used in our model.
